# Unix 6th Edition Kernel
Source code was extracted from this [archive](https://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v6/) (`v6root/usr/sys`).

*Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition* and *[PDP-11 Handbook](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/readings/pdp11-40.pdf)* are helpful for understanding the source code, especially the handbook. After I skimmed the handbook, it became easier to follow Lions' book and source code. Before starting with Lions' book, I went through *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* and *MIT 6.S081 and its labs* to grab foundamental knowledge on operating system. It is like a journey by reading Lions' book.
